                Hello, My name is Han Sung and I'll give a quick bio about myself. I recently graduated from Penn State University, with a degree in Kinesiology but chose not to pursue graduate school because I started to get fascinated by technology and coding.
                It started out simply with tutorials on freecodecamp.org and codeacademy.com. As I gradually finishing most of the tutorials on these sites, I realized that coding was becoming a passion of mine
                and also became fascinated by concepts like articial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing/architecture, blockchain, and data analytics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I ended up enrolling and graduating from The University of Pennsylvania's Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp in the winter of 2018. 
                My goal is to get immersed within the coding world as fast as possible, whether it be an entry level web development or junior web developemnt job, and continually strive and pursue to learn new technological frameworks and advance my coding literacy.
                I never want to stop at being a junior developer, but hope to keep advancing and be the best I can be as a coder.
                Though I know this process will involve moments of confusion, questions, and google searching on stackoverflow and quora, I am ready to take this development journey.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As for interests outside of technology, I love sports, especially Philly sports (Eagles, Sixers, Phillies)! As well as UFC/MMA, soccer, and tennis. 
                Biking is also a passion of mine, and I hope to one day bike across the United States.
            </p>
