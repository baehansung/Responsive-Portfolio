                Quick fun fact; In Korean culture, nearly all Korean names are three syllables long (2 for the first name and 1 for the last name). So my first name is Han Sung, but I also go by Han.
                Anyways, about me... I recently graduated from Penn State University, but towards the end, I no longer wanted to pursue graduate school. 
                I was confused for a while on what to do, and eventually I started getting into tech. I really got fascinated by how society will dramatically change in the near future due to technological advancements, 
                and I also find concepts like articial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing/architecture, and data analytics very interesting. Plus, I love blockchain related stuff and personally think it will revolutionize so many different industries.

                I love sports, especially Philly sports! As well as UFC/MMA, soccer (Manchester United, Korea International, United States International), and tennis. 
                Biking is also starting to be a passion of mine, and I hope to one day bike across the United States.

                As for coding, currently (5/6/18) our bootcamp class is coding our own portfolio sites. Although coding languages like JavaScript is incredibly challenging at times, 
                I know that anyone with perseverence and determination will continually grow. Hopefully, I'll have some cool stuff for you in the Portfolio section soon!
